I have been using Atom for a while and enjoyed it quite a lot so I decided to write a short guide for those who want to try Atom (you won't be disappointed!).

First and foremost, check out their [homepage](https://atom.io/) for the main features. They did quite a good job of convincing me to at least try it out in the first place.

## Why I choose Atom

### 1.Nice syntax highlighting

I love the color schemes of Atom and its simple yet elegant UI in general. The syntax highlighting for (almost) every popular language is **built-in**, so I didn't have to do any tweaking and fixing.

### 2. Working with Git becomes so much easier

This website is rendered by Github Pages (Jekyll) and I built the whole thing inside Atom. Atom git automatically tracks changes, allows you to review them and helps with some extra *thingy* related to git functions.

### 3. Plugins

Atom has [a huge library of plugins](https://atom.io/packages) built by its community which allows you to customize the text editor at will. I always say to my friend *"Atom is simple yet so flexible that it can become anything you want"*.

## 4. Speed

Atom is a **light-weight and fast text editor**, that is why I choose it over VS Code which is a more popular alternative. VS Code can do a bit more, but runs slower. I prioritize performance over functions I don't need.

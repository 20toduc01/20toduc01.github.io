I have using Atom for a while and enjoyed it quite a lot so I decided to write a short guide for those who want to try it out (you won't be disappointed!).

First and foremost, check out their [homepage](https://atom.io/) for the main features. They did quite a good job of convincing me to download Atom.

### 2. Working with Git becomes so much easier

Problem: Given a graph (directed or undirected), find the path between 2 vertices **u** and **v** with the minimum value of sum over edges on the path.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    return 0;
    cout << "Bact\n";
    int syntax = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cout << endl;
}
```

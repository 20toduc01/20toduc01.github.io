                    Have you ever pondered upon our existence in this strange universe?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you like to discuss programming related matters?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or do you, by any chance, like to talk about weeb-shit?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the answers are YES, awesome! If not, since you are here anyway, <red>let me show you around! </red>

                <p> My name is <red> Đức</red>. Throughout my middle school years I had grown fond of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">competitive programming</a> (never got a chance to git gud at it).
                    Later on I got to learn amazing things about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">our cosmos</a> and related philosophy matters. The creation of this site helps me share them all with my friends, loved ones and
                    possibly strangers as well.
